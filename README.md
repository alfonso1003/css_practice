I know CSS well enough. I mean, I can look things up. (Just like still have to look up how to center a div!) Anyway, I have to get better and learn some more sophisticated things. So here are some lessons I'm pulling from random sites. I'll do a few of these every week and in time I'll be an expert.

To get the code running, clone the repo and then set up a server using node.js, like so:

```
npm install -g http-server livereload
cd ~\...\css_practice
http-server -c-1
```

Then navigate to the site the server points you to, in my case: localhost:8080. If you can't view changes to your code immediately on the browser, try a hard refresh, i.e., command-shift-R. I'll work on making this automatic.
